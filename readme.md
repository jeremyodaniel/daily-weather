# daily-weather

AS A traveler<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br><br><br><br><br><br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br><br><br><br><br>

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br><br><br><br>
WHEN I search for a city<br><br><br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br><br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br>
WHEN I view the UV index<br><br><br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br><br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity<br><br><br><br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br><br><br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city<br><br>
